# Carriage pattern - this will determine what carriage CCU is located in by looking up designation.
# For ex. "_5" will mean 2nd digit of CCU designation determines car and it is car 5 we have CCUs for
# this fleet. Similary you can set "5" for using first digit as variable. And "__5" for 3rd digit. If this is
# left empty then CCU designation = CCU carriage name. Also you can use "--5__" in which case first 2
# characters are ignored.
